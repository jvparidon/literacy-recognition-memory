# literacy-recognition-memory
Data and code accompanying "Learning to read does not compete with face and object recognition".  
The `html_notebooks` directory contains complete html versions of the Jupyter notebooks in which we performed the analysis for this paper. If you want to reproduce the analysis, you can run the `.ipynb` notebooks in the main directory (but note that these are not pre-populated with output like the html notebooks are).

We have split the analysis into four notebooks for convenience, please execute them in the correct sequence if you want to reproduce the analysis:
1. Digit span models
2. Raven's models
3. Reading models
4. Object recognition models
