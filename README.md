# On the contents of this repository
This repository contains data and code accompanying the _Psychological Science_ article "Does neuronal recycling result in destructive competition? The influence of learning to read on the recognition of faces."

We have split the statistical analysis into four Jupyter notebooks; fully rendered HTML versions of these notebooks are available through these links:
1. [Digit span models](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jvparidon/literacy-recognition-memory/blob/master/html_notebooks/digit_span_models.html)
2. [Raven's models](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jvparidon/literacy-recognition-memory/blob/master/html_notebooks/ravens_models.html)
3. [Reading models](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jvparidon/literacy-recognition-memory/blob/master/html_notebooks/reading_models.html)
4. [Object recognition models](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jvparidon/literacy-recognition-memory/blob/master/html_notebooks/object_recognition_models.html)

(There is a fifth notebook, [object recognition models, reversed](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jvparidon/literacy-recognition-memory/blob/master/html_notebooks/object_recognition_models_reversed.html), which we created in order to respond to a question from an anonymous reviewer about the order of statistical operations. Since this notebook might be of interest to others as well, we are sharing it here, but note that this is **not** the analysis reported in the article published in _Psychological Science_.)

If you want to reproduce the analysis, you can download or clone this repository, and run the interactive Jupyter (`.ipynb`) notebooks included in the main directory (note that these notebooks are pre-populated with output like the HTML notebooks linked above, but this output can be overwritten). Running these notebooks will require having a recent version of both Python and Jupyter notebooks installed (as well as several other Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`).
