# literacy-recognition-memory
Data and code accompanying "Learning to read does not compete with face and object recognition".

We have split the analysis into four notebooks for convenience; fully rendered versions are available through these links:
1. [Digit span models](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jvparidon/literacy-recognition-memory/blob/master/html_notebooks/digit_span_models.html)
2. [Raven's models](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jvparidon/literacy-recognition-memory/blob/master/html_notebooks/ravens_models.html)
3. [Reading models](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jvparidon/literacy-recognition-memory/blob/master/html_notebooks/reading_models.html)
4. [Object recognition models](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jvparidon/literacy-recognition-memory/blob/master/html_notebooks/object_recognition_models.html)

If you want to reproduce the analysis, you can run download or clone this repository, and run the interactive Jupyter (`.ipynb`) notebooks in the `clean_notebooks` directory (note that these are not pre-populated with output like the html notebooks linked above).
